#Things to do
<p> 1.  Setting up bot
    2.  Write wrapper controller for DE2 being controlled by RPI over UART
    3.  Testing for error
        - turns
        - driving in straight lines
            moving back and forth reciprocation
    4.  Callibration correction for determined error
    5.  Choose Reset Position
    6.  Decicde on base path to be Traveled
    7. Detect Intruder
          - False Positives
              Intruder Behavior
          - Discarding Data
          - Trigonometry?
